## About

LinkCheckerBot checks the comments made my LinkFixerBot to see if the fixed links link to existing users or subreddits.
If not, LinkCheckerBot replies to them saying so.

## Why?

Yea, it's probably a stupid idea but you know what? Why not? Some of these links don't actually work.
Reddit takes a noticeable amount of time to load so if this can save even a small amount of time, I'd say
that's a good enough reason.

## Changelog

### 1.2.0

Bot only replies if the linked user or subreddit doesn't exist, as suggested by LinkFixerBot's creator.

### 1.1.0

Bot runs forever now. Goes through all of LinkFixerBot's new comments.

### 1.0.0

First version. Only looks through LinkFixerBot's most recent 3 comments and replies with a status report, then shuts down.
